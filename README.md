# Glowing runes

This is a sample project to demonstrate how to use animations with emission maps on Unity Shader Graph.

## Unity Version
2020.3.10 (LTS)

## Shader Graphs

1. Assets/Shaders/Dirt.shadergraph: This is a simple shader graph to mimick the usage of decals, used to project dirt marks and cracks on walls and floor
2. Assets/Shaders/GlowingRunes.shadergraph: This is the shader graph used to render the main cube in the scene. It reproduces the functionalities of the Lit shader (Specular workflow) and adds an animation to the emission map to give the impression that the runes are glowing.
